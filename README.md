# 🛒 Amazon Reviews Sentiment Analysis Using BERT

## 📄 Project Description
This project focuses on analyzing Amazon product reviews through **deep learning-based sentiment classification** using **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)**.  
The dataset utilized is from Kaggle: [Amazon Reviews Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kritanjalijain/amazon-reviews).

The trained model is available on Hugging Face here:
